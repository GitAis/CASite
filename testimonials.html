            <h1>Welcome to BrianFitzer Illustration</h1>
        <h2>Brian Delivers Images & Imagination for YOUR project</h2>
        I was put in touch with Brian via a friend when a book I was producing called Moonwalking For Dentists was at an advanced stage. He quickly grasped the brief and worked with me to find solutions as I was a bit stuck. Brian was full of original ideas, fast and, most importantly, extremely talented. We couldn't have asked for better art - it truly elevated the book - and we'll be using him again.

     <h2>Testimonial</h2>
 Brian Fitzgerald is an excellent illustrator and a pleasure to work with. He can adapt styles to suit the subject, and you can always rely on him to keep to schedules – both qualities very necessary in book publishing!
